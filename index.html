  <h3> 2. Computer Biography</h3>
  <p>I have learned a little bit of Java, but have mainly learned
    C++ through the University. I know how to troubleshoot and
    disassembling PC's. What motivated me to take a course in web
    development was an interest about the computer world and other
    technologies around the world. Being able to create your own website
    and publishing anything to grab other people's attention intrigued me.
    My dad is a Systems Administrator and I want to do what he does, since
    computers are advancing more and more each year. I have always found
    web development interesting and was always curious in learning it.
