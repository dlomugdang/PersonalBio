  <h3> 2. Computer Biography</h3>
  <div>
  <p>Similar to what I have on my resume... I have learned a little bit of Java,
    but have mainly learned C++ and SQL through the University. I know how to troubleshoot
    and disassembling PC's. Software applications that I have used are Photoshop and
    Microsoft Office, and Caspio. What motivated me to take a course in web
    development was an interest about the computer world and other
    technologies around the world. Being able to create your own website
    and publishing anything to grab other people's attention intrigued me.
    My dad is a Systems Administrator and I want to do what he does, since
    computers are advancing more and more each year. I have always found
    web development interesting and was always curious in learning it.
